TEARS for my lady dead,
Heliodore!
Salt tears and ill to shed
Over and o’er.
Tears for my lady dead,
Sighs do we send,
Long love rememberéd,
Mistress and friend.
Sad are the songs we sing,
Tears that we shed,
Empty the gifts we bring,
Gifts to the dead.
Go tears, and go lament!
Fare from her tomb,
Wend where my lady went,
Down through the gloom.
Ah, for my flower, my love,
Hades hath taken!
Ah for the dust above,
Scattered and shaken!
Mother of all things born,
Earth, in thy breast
Lull her that all men mourn,
Gently to rest!
