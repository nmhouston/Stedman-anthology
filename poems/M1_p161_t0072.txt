I ’M a bird that ’s free
Of the land and sea,
I wander whither I will;
But oft on the wing,
I falter and sing,
Oh, fluttering heart, be still, Be still,
Oh, fluttering heart, be still!
I ’m wild as the wind,
But soft and kind,
And wander whither I may;
The eyebright sighs,
And says with its eyes,
Thou wandering wind, oh stay, Oh stay,
Thou wandering wind, oh stay!A Sicilian Summer.
