WEEP not! tears must vainly fall,
Though they fall like rain:
Sorrow’s flood shall not recall
Love ’s dear life again.
Vain thy tears,
Vain thy sobs;
As vain heart-throbs
Of lonely years
Since thou Love hast slain.

Sigh not! As a passed wind
Is but sought in vain,
Sighs nor groans may not unbind
Death’s unbroken chain.
Sighs and tears
Nought avail,
Nor cheeks grown pale
In lonely years.
Love comes not again.
