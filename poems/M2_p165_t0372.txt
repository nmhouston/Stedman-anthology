IT was her first sweet child, her heart’s delight:
And, though we all foresaw his early doom,
We kept the fearful secret out of sight;
We saw the canker, but she kiss’d the bloom.
And yet it might not be: we could not brook
To vex her happy heart with vague alarms,
To blanch with fear her fond intrepid look,
Or send a thrill through those encircling arms.
She smil’d upon him, waking or at rest:
She could not dream her little child would die:
She toss’d him fondly with an upward eye:
She seem’d as buoyant as a summer spray,
That dances with a blossom on its breast,
Nor knows how soon it will be borne away.
