“FOREVER with the Lord!”
Amen, so let it be;
Life from the dead is in that word,
’T is immortality.

Here in the body pent,
Absent from him I roam,
Yet nightly pitch my moving tent
A day’s march nearer home.

My Father’s house on high,
Home of my soul, how near
At times, to faith’s foreseeing eye,
Thy golden gates appear!

Ah! then my spirit faints
To reach the land I love,
The bright inheritance of saints,
Jerusalem above.

Yet clouds will intervene,
And all my prospect flies;
Like Noah’s dove, I flit between
Rough seas and stormy skies.

Anon the clouds dispart,
The winds and waters cease,
While sweetly o’er my gladden’d heart
Expands the bow of peace.

Beneath its glowing arch,
Along the hallow’d ground,
I see cherubic armies march,
A camp of fire around.

I hear at morn and even,
At noon and midnight hour,
The choral harmonies of heaven
Earth’s Babel-tongues o’erpower.

Then, then I feel that he,
Remember’d or forgot,
The Lord, is never far from me,
Though I perceive him not.
