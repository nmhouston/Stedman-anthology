IN the wild autumn weather, when the rain was on the sea,
And the boughs sobbed together, Death came and spake to me:
“Those red drops of thy heart I have come to take from thee;
As the storm sheds the rose, so thy love shall broken be,”
Said Death to me.

Then I stood straight and fearless while the rain was in the wave,
And I spake low and tearless: “When thou hast made my grave,
Those red drops from my heart then thou shalt surely have;
But the rose keeps its bloom, as I my love will save
All for my grave.”

In the wild autumn weather a dread sword slipped from its sheath;
While the boughs sobbed together, I fought a fight with Death,
And I vanquished him with prayer, and I vanquished him by faith:
Now the summer air is sweet with the rose’s fragrant breath
That conquered Death.
