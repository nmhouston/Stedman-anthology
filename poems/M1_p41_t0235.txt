I WILL not have the mad Clytie,
Whose head is turn’d by the sun;
The tulip is a courtly quean,
Whom, therefore I will shun;
The cowslip is a country wench,
The violet is a nun;
But I will woo the dainty rose,
The queen of every one.

The pea is but a wanton witch,
In too much haste to wed,
And clasps her rings on every hand;
The wolfsbane I should dread;
Nor will I dreary rosemarye,
That always mourns the dead;
But I will woo the dainty rose,
With her cheeks of tender red.

The lily is all in white, like a saint,
And so is no mate for me,
And the daisy’s cheek is tipp’d with a blush,
She is of such low degree;
Jasmine is sweet, and has many loves,
And the broom’s betroth’d to the bee;
But I will plight with the dainty rose,
For fairest of all is she.
