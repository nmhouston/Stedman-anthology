WHEN my feet have wander’d
From the narrow way
Out into the desert,
Gone like sheep astray;
Soil’d and sore with travel
Through the ways of men,
All too weak to bear me
Back to Thee again:
Hear me, O my Father!
From Thy mercy-seat,
Save me by the passion
Of the bleeding feet!

When my hands, unholy
Through some sinful deed
Wrought in me, have freshly
Made my Saviour’s bleed:
And I cannot lift up
Mine to Thee in prayer,
Tied and bound, and holden
Back by my despair:
Then, my Father! loose them,
Break for me their bands,
Save me by the passion
Of the bleeding hands!

When my thoughts, unruly,
Dare to doubt of Thee,
And thy ways to question
Deem is to be free:
Till, through cloud and darkness,
Wholly gone astray,
They find no returning
To the narrow way:
Then, my God! mine only
Trust and truth art Thou;
Save me by the passion
Of the bleeding brow!

When my heart, forgetful
Of the love that yet,
Though by man forgotten,
Never can forget;
All its best affections
Spent on things below,
In its sad despondings
Knows not where to go:
Then, my God! mine only
Hope and help Thou art;
Save me by the passion
Of the bleeding heart!
