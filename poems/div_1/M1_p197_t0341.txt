I HEARD the voice of Jesus say,
Come unto me and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon my breast.
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad,
I found in him a resting-place,
And he has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
Behold, I freely give
The living water,—thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live.
I came to Jesus and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quench’d, my soul reviv’d,
And now I live in him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
I am this dark world’s light,
Look unto me, thy morn shall rise
And all thy day be bright.
I look’d to Jesus, and I found
In him my Star, my Sun;
And in that light of life I ’ll walk
Till travelling days are done.
