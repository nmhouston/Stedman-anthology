AND is the swallow gone?
Who beheld it?
Which way sail’d it?
Farewell bade it none?

No mortal saw it go:
But who doth hear
Its summer cheer
As it flitteth to and fro?

So the freed spirit flies!
From its surrounding clay
It steals away
Like the swallow from the skies.

Whither? wherefore doth it go?
’T is all unknown:
We feel alone
That a void is left below.
