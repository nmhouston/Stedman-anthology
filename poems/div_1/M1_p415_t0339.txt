O LORD of heaven, and earth, and sea!
To thee all praise and glory be;
How shall we show our love to thee,
Who givest all등ho givest all?

The golden sunshine, vernal air,
Sweet flowers and fruit thy love declare;
When harvests ripen, thou art there,
Who givest all등ho givest all.

For peaceful homes and healthful days,
For all the blessings earth displays,
We owe thee thankfulness and praise,
Who givest all등ho givest all.

For souls redeem뇫, for sins forgiven,
For means of grace and hopes of heaven,
What can to thee, O Lord! be given,
Who givest all등ho givest all?

We lose what on ourselves we spend,
We have, as treasures without end,
Whatever, Lord, to thee we lend,
Who givest all등ho givest all.

Whatever, Lord, we lend to thee,
Repaid a thousand-fold will be;
Then gladly will we give to thee,
Who givest all등ho givest all.
