TWIST thou and twine! in light and gloom
A spell is on thine hand;
The wind shall be thy changeful loom,
Thy web the shifting sand.
Twine from this hour, in ceaseless toil,
On Blackrock’s sullen shore;
Till cordage of the sand shall coil
Where crested surges roar.
’T is for that hour, when, from the wave,
Near voices wildly cried;
When thy stern hand no succor gave,
The cable at thy side.
Twist thou and twine! in light and gloom
The spell is on thine hand;
The wind shall be thy changeful loom,
Thy web the shifting sand.
