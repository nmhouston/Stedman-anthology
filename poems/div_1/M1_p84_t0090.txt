POOR old pilgrim Misery,
Beneath the silent moon he sate,
A-listening to the screech owl’s cry
And the cold wind’s goblin prate;
Beside him lay his staff of yew
With wither’d willow twin’d,
His scant gray hair all wet with dew,
His cheeks with grief ybrin’d;
And his cry it was ever, alack!
Alack, and woe is me!

Anon a wanton imp astray
His piteous moaning hears,
And from his bosom steals away
His rosary of tears:
With his plunder fled that urchin elf,
And hid it in your eyes;
Then tell me back the stolen pelf,
Give up the lawless prize;
Or your cry shall be ever, alack!
Alack, and woe is me!
