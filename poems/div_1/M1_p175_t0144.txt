COLONOS! can it be that thou hast still
Thy laurel and thine olives and thy vine?
Do thy close-feather’d nightingales yet trill
Their warbles of thick-sobbing song divine?
Does the gold sheen of the crocus o’er thee shine
And dew-fed clusters of the daffodil,
And round thy flowery knots Cephisus twine,
Aye oozing up with many a bubbling rill?
Oh, might I stand beside thy leafy knoll,
In sight of the far-off city-towers, and see
The faithful-hearted pure Antigone
Toward the dread precinct, leading sad and slow
That awful temple of a kingly soul,
Lifted to heaven by unexampled woe!
