’T WAS just before the hay was mown,
The season had been wet and cold,
When my good dame began to groan,
And speak of days and years of old:
Ye were a young man then, and gay,
And raven black your handsome hair;
Ah! Time steals many a grace away,
And leaves us many a grief to bear.

Tush! tush! said I, we’ve had our time,
And if ’t were here again ’t would go;
The youngest cannot keep their prime,
The darkest head some gray must show.
We ’ve been together forty years,
And though it seem but like a day,
We ’ve much less cause, dear dame, for tears,
Than many who have trod life’s way.

Goodman, said she, ye ’re always right,
And ’t is a pride to hear your tongue;
And though your fine old head be white,
’T is dear to me as when ’t were young.
So give your hand,—’t was never shown
But in affection unto me;
And I shall be beneath the stone,
And lifeless, when I love not thee.
