THEY call her fair. I do not know:
I never thought to look.
Who heeds the binder’s costliest show
When he may read the book?

What need a list of parts to me
When I possess the whole?
Who only watch her eyes to see
The color of her soul.

I may not praise her mouth, her chin,
Her feet, her hands, her arms:
My love lacks leisure to begin
The schedule of her charms.

To praise is only to compare:
And therefore Love is blind.
I lov’d before I was aware
Her beauty was of kind.
