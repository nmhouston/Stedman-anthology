I LIV’D with visions for my company
Instead of men and women, years ago,
And found them gentle mates, nor thought to know
A sweeter music than they play’d to me.
But soon their trailing purple was not free
Of this world’s dust, their lutes did silent grow,
And I myself grew faint and blind below
Their vanishing eyes. Then THOU didst come—to be,
Beloved, what they seem’d. Their shining fronts,
Their songs, their splendors, (better, yet the same,
As river-water hallow’d into fonts)
Met in thee, and from out thee overcame
My soul with satisfaction of all wants:
Because God’s gift puts man’s best dreams to shame.
