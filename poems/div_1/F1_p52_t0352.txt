MY God (oh, let me call thee mine,
Weak, wretched sinner though I be),
My trembling soul would fain be thine;
My feeble faith still clings to thee.

Not only for the past I grieve,
The future fills me with dismay;
Unless Thou hasten to relieve,
Thy suppliant is a castaway.

I cannot say my faith is strong,
I dare not hope my love is great;
But strength and love to thee belong;
Oh, do not leave me desolate!

I know I owe my all to thee;
Oh, take the heart I cannot give!
Do Thou my strength—my Saviour be,
And make me to thy glory live.
