THIS infant world has taken long to make!
Nor hast Thou done the making of it yet,
But wilt be working on when death has set
A new mound in some church-yard for my sake.
On flow the centuries without a break;
Uprise the mountains, ages without let;
The lichens suck the rock’s breast—food they get:
Years more than past, the young earth yet will take.
But in the dumbness of the rolling time,
No veil of silence shall encompass me:
Thou wilt not once forget and let me be;
Rather wouldst Thou some old chaotic prime
Invade, and, with a tenderness sublime,
Unfold a world, that I, thy child, might see.
