ALL things journey: sun and moon,
Morning, noon, and afternoon,
Night and all her stars:
’Twixt the east and western bars
Round they journey,
Come and go.
We go with them!
For to roam and ever roam
Is the Zíncali’s loved home.

Earth is good, the hillside breaks
By the ashen roots and makes
Hungry nostrils glad;
Then we run till we are mad,
Like the horses,
And we cry,
None shall catch us!
Swift winds wing us—we are free—
Drink the air—we Zíncali!

Falls the snow: the pine-branch split,
Call the fire out, see it flit,
Through the dry leaves run,
Spread and glow, and make a sun
In the dark tent:
O warm dark!
Warm as conies!
Strong fire loves us, we are warm!
Who the Zíncali shall harm?

Onward journey: fires are spent;
Sunward, sunward! lift the tent,
Run before the rain,
Through the pass, along the plain.
Hurry, hurry,
Lift us, wind!
Like the horses.
For to roam and ever roam
Is the Zíncali’s loved home.
