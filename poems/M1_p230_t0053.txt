GENTLY!—gently!—down!—down!
From the starry courts on high,
Gently step adown, down
The ladder of the sky.

Sunbeam steps are strong enough
For such airy feet:
Spirits, blow your trumpets rough,
So as they be sweet!

Breathe them loud, the Queen descending,
Yet a lowly welcome breathe,
Like so many flowerets bending
Zephyr’s breezy foot beneath.
