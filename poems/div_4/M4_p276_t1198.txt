THE VILLEINS clustered round the bowl
At merrie Yule to make good cheer,
And drank with froth on beard and jowl:
“Was-hael to the Thane!
May never Breton taste our beer,
Nor Dane.”

Till the red cock on the chimney crew,
And each man cried with a mighty yawn
As the tapster one more flagon drew:
“To the Saxon land was-hael!
May we never want for mast-fed brawn
Nor ale!”

The thane took up the stirrup-cup
And blew off the reaming head,
And at one draught he swigged it up
And smacked his lips and said:
“Was-hael to coulter and sword!
Was-hael to hearth and hall!
To Saxon land and Saxon lord
And thrall.”
