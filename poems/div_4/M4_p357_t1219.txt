THERE lies a little city leagues away.
Its wharves the green sea washes all day long.
Its busy, sun-bright wharves with sailors’ song
And clamor of trade ring loud the live-long day.
Into the happy harbor hastening, gay
With press of snowy canvas, tall ships throng.
The peopled streets to blithe-eyed Peace belong,
Glad housed beneath these crowding roofs of gray.
’T was long ago this city prospered so,
For yesterday a woman died therein.
Since when the wharves are idle fallen, I know,
And in the streets is hushed the pleasant din;
The thronging ships have been, the songs have been;—
Since yesterday it is so long ago.
