O DEEP of Heaven, ’t is thou alone art boundless,
’T is thou alone our balance shall not weigh,
’T is thou alone our fathom-line finds soundless,—
Whose infinite our finite must obey!
Through thy blue realms and down thy starry reaches
Thought voyages forth beyond thy furthest fire,
And homing from no sighted shoreline, teaches
Thee measureless as is the soul’s desire.
O deep of Heaven! No beam of Pleiad ranging
Eternity may bridge thy gulf of spheres!
The ceaseless hum that fills thy sleep unchanging
Is rain of the innumerable years.
Our worlds, our suns, our ages,—these but stream
Through thine abiding like a dateless dream.
