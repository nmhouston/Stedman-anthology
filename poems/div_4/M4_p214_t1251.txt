HAVE little care that Life is brief,
And less that Art is long.
Success is in the silences
Though Fame is in the song.

With the Orient in her eyes,
Life my mistress lured me on.
“Knowledge,” said that look of hers,
“Shall be yours when all is done.”

Like a pomegranate in halves,
“Drink me,” said that mouth of hers,
And I drank who now am here
Where my dust with dust confers.
