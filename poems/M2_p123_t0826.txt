A WIDOW,—she had only one!
A puny and decrepit son;
But, day and night,
Though fretful oft, and weak and small,
A loving child, he was her all,—
The Widow’s Mite.

The Widow’s Mite—ay, so sustain’d,
She battled onward, nor complain’d
Though friends were fewer:
And while she toil’d for daily fare,
A little crutch upon the stair
Was music to her.

I saw her then, and now I see
That, though resign’d and cheerful, she
Has sorrow’d much:
She has,—HE gave it tenderly,—
Much faith, and, carefully laid by,
A little crutch.
