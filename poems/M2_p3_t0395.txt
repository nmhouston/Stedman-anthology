THERE is no land like England
Where’er the light of day be;
There are no hearts like English hearts,
Such hearts of oak as they be.
There is no land like England
Where’er the light of day be;
There are no men like Englishmen,
So tall and bold as they be.

And these will strike for England
And man and maid be free
To foil and spoil the tyrant
Beneath the greenwood tree.

There is no land like England
Where’er the light of day be;
There are no wives like English wives,
So fair and chaste as they be.
There is no land like England
Where’er the light of day be;
There are no maids like the English maids,
So beautiful as they be.

And these shall wed with freemen,
And all their sons be free,
To sing the songs of England
Beneath the greenwood tree.
