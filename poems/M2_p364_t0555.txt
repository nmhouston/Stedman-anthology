ROLL on, and with thy rolling crust
That round thy poles thou twirlest,
Roll with thee, Earth, this grain of dust,
As through the Vast thou whirlest;
On, on through zones of dark and light
Still waft me, blind and reeling,
Around the sun, and with his flight
In wilder orbits wheeling.

Speed on through deeps without a shore,
This Atom with thee bearing,
Thyself a grain of dust—no more—
’Mid fume of systems flaring.
Ah, what am I to thirst for power,
Or pore on Nature’s pages,—
Whirl’d onward, living for an hour,
And dead through endless ages?
