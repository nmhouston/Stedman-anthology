LORD, for to-morrow and its needs
I do not pray;
Keep me from any stain of sin
Just for to-day:
Let me both diligently work
And duly pray;
Let me be kind in word and deed
Just for to-day,
Let me be slow to do my will—
Prompt to obey:
Help me to sacrifice myself
Just for to-day.
Let me no wrong or idle word
Unthinking say—
Set thou thy seal upon my lips,
Just for to-day.
So for to-morrow and its needs
I do not pray,
But keep me, guide me, hold me, Lord,
Just for to-day.
