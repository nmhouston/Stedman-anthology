LADY and gentlemen fays, come buy!
No pedlar has such a rich packet as I.

Who wants a gown
Of purple fold,
Embroider’d down
The seams with gold?
See here!—a Tulip richly laced
To please a royal fairy’s taste!

Who wants a cap
Of crimson grand?
By great good hap
I ’ve one on hand:
Look, sir!—a Cock’s-comb, flowering red,
’T is just the thing, sir, for your head!

Who wants a frock
Of vestal hue?
Or snowy smock?—
Fair maid, do you?
O me!—a Ladysmock so white!
Your bosom’s self is not more bright.

Who wants to sport
A slender limb?
I ’ve every sort
Of hose for him:
Both scarlet, striped, and yellow ones:
This Woodbine makes such pantaloons!

Who wants—(hush! hush!)
A box of paint?
’T will give a blush
Yet leave no taint:
This rose with natural rouge is fill’d,
From its own dewy leaves distill’d.

Then lady and gentlemen fays, come buy!
You never will meet such a merchant as I!
