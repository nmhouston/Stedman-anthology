IN Childhood’s unsuspicious hours
The fairies crown’d my head with flowers.

Youth came: I lay at Beauty’s feet;
She smil’d and said my song was sweet.

Then Age, and, Love no longer mine,
My brows I shaded with the vine.

With flowers and love and wine and song,
O Death! life hath not been too long.
