YEAR after year
The leaf and the shoot;
The babe and the nestling,
The worm at the root;
The bride at the altar,
The corpse on the bier—
The Earth and its story,
Year after year.

Whither are tending,
And whence do they rise,
The cycles of changes,
The worlds in their skies,
The seasons that roll’d
Ere I flash’d from the gloom,
And will roll on as now
When I ’m dust in the tomb?
