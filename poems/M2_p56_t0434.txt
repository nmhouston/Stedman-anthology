“AND even our women,” lastly grumbles Ben,
“Leaving their nature, dress and talk like men!”
A damsel, as our train stops at Five Ashes,
Down to the station in a dog-cart dashes.
A footman buys her ticket, “Third class, parly;”
And, in huge-button’d coat and “Champagne Charley”
And such scant manhood else as use allows her,
Her two shy knees bound in a single trouser,
With, ’twixt her shapely lips, a violet
Perch’d as a proxy for a cigarette,
She takes her window in our smoking carriage,
And scans us, calmly scorning men and marriage.
Ben frowns in silence; older, I know better
Than to read ladies ’havior in the letter.
This aping man is crafty Love’s devising
To make the woman’s difference more surprising;
And, as for feeling wroth at such rebelling,
Who ’d scold the child for now and then repelling
Lures with “I won’t!” or for a moment’s straying
In its sure growth towards more full obeying?
“Yes, she had read the ‘Legend of the Ages,’
And George Sand too, skipping the wicked pages.”
And, whilst we talk’d, her protest firm and perky
Against mankind, I thought, grew lax and jerky;
And, at a compliment, her mouth’s compressure
Nipp’d in its birth a little laugh of pleasure;
And smiles, forbidden her lips, as weakness horrid,
Broke, in grave lights, from eyes and chin and forehead;
And, as I push’d kind ’vantage’ gainst the scorner,
The two shy knees press’d shyer to the corner;
And Ben began to talk with her, the rather
Because he found out that he knew her father,
Sir Francis Applegarth, of Fenny Compton,
And danced once with her sister Maude at Brompton;
And then he star’d until he quite confus’d her,
More pleas’d with her than I, who but excus’d her;
And, when she got out, he, with sheepish glances,
Said he’d stop too, and call on old Sir Francis.
