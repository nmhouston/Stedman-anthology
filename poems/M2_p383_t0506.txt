IT is buried and done with,
The love that we knew:
Those cobwebs we spun with
Are beaded with dew.

I lov’d thee; I leave thee:
To love thee was pain:
I dare not believe thee,
To love thee again.

Like spectres unshriven
Are the years that I lost;
To thee they were given
Without count of cost.

I cannot revive them
By penance or prayer:
Hell’s tempest must drive them
Through turbulent air.

Farewell, and forget me;
For I too am free
From the shame that beset me,
The sorrow of thee.
