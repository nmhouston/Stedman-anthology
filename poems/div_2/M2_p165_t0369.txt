HOW oft I ’ve watch’d thee from the garden croft,
In silence, when the busy day was done,
Shining with wondrous brilliancy aloft,
And flickering like a casement ’gainst the sun!
I ’ve seen thee soar from out some snowy cloud,
Which held the frozen breath of land and sea,
Yet broke and sever’d as the wind grew loud—
But earth-bound winds could not dismember thee,
Nor shake thy frame of jewels; I have guess’d
At thy strange shape and function, haply felt
The charm of that old myth about thy belt
And sword; but, most, my spirit was possess’d
By His great Presence, Who is never far
From his light-bearers, whether man or star.
