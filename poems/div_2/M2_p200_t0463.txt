O LONG ago, when Faeryland
Arose new born, King Oberon
Walk’d pensive on the yellow strand,
And wearied, for he liv’d alone.

“Why have I none, he said, to love?”
When soft a wind began to fleet
Across the moonlit sea, and drove
A lonely shallop to his feet.

Of pearl, and rubies red, and gold,
That shell was made, and in it lay
Titania fast asleep, and roll’d
In roses, and in flowers of May.

He wak’d her with a loving kiss,
Her arms around him softly clung;
And none can ever tell the bliss
These had when Faeryland was young.
