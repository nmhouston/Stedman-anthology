THE LADY of the Hills with crimes untold
Follow’d my feet, with azure eyes of prey;
By glacier-brink she stood,—by cataract-spray—
When mists were dire, or avalanche-echoes roll’d.
At night she glimmer’d in the death-wind cold,
And if a foot-print shone at break of day,
My flesh would quail, but straight my soul would say:
“’T is hers whose hand God’s mightier hand doth hold.”
I trod her snow bridge, for the moon was bright,
Her icicle-arch across the sheer crevasse,
When lo, she stood!… God made her let me pass,
Then fell’d the bridge!… Oh, there in sallow light,
There down the chasm, I saw her cruel, white,
And all my wondrous days as in a glass.
