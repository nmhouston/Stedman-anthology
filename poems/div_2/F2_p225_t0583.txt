LOOK at me with thy large brown eyes,
Philip, my king.
Round whom the enshadowing purple lies
Of babyhood’s royal dignities.
Lay on my neck thy tiny hand
With love’s invisible sceptre laden;
I am thine Esther to command
Till thou shalt find a queen-handmaiden,
Philip, my king.

Oh the day when thou goest a wooing,
Philip, my king.
When some beautiful lips ’gin suing,
And some gentle heart’s bars undoing
Thou dost enter, love-crown’d, and there
Sittest love-glorified. Rule kindly,
Tenderly, over thy kingdom fair,
For we that love, ah! we love so blindly,
Philip, my king.

Up from thy sweet mouth,—up to thy brow,
Philip, my king.
The spirit that here lies sleeping now
May rise like a giant and make men bow
As to one heaven-chosen among his peers.
My Saul, than thy brethren taller and fairer,
Let me behold thee in future years!
Yet thy head needeth a circlet rarer,
Philip, my king.

—A wreath not of gold, but palm. One day,
Philip, my king.
Thou too must tread, as we trod, a way
Thorny and cruel and cold and gray:
Rebels within thee, and foes without,
Will snatch at thy crown. But march on, glorious,
Martyr, yet monarch! till angels shout,
As thou sit’st at the feet of God victorious,
“Philip, the king!”
