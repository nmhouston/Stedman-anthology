PARDON the faults in me,
For the love of years ago:
Good-by.
I must drift across the sea,
I must sink into the snow,
I must die.

You can bask in this sun,
You can drink wine, and eat:
Good-by.
I must gird myself and run
Though with unready feet:
I must die.

Blank sea to sail upon,
Cold bed to sleep in:
Good-by.
While you clasp, I must be gone
For all your weeping:
I must die.

A kiss for one friend,
And a word for two,—
Good-by:—
A lock that you must send,
A kindness you must do:
I must die.

Not a word for you.
Not a lock or kiss,
Good-by:—
We, one, must part in two;
Verily death is this:
I must die.
