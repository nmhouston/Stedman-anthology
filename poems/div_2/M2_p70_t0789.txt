O YOUTH whose hope is high,
Who doth to truth aspire,
Whether thou live or die,
O look not back nor tire.

Thou that art bold to fly
Through tempest, flood and fire,
Nor dost not shrink to try
Thy heart in torments dire,—

If thou canst Death defy,
If thy Faith is entire,
Press onward, for thine eye
Shall see thy heart’s desire.

Beauty and love are nigh,
And with their deathless quire
Soon shall thine eager cry
Be number’d and expire.
