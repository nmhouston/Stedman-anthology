I HAD a true-love, none so dear,
And a friend both leal and tried:
I had a cask of good old beer,
And a gallant horse to ride.

A little while did Fortune smile
On him and her and me:
We sang along the road of life
Like birds upon a tree.

My lady fell to shame and hell,
And with her took my friend;
My cask ran sour, my horse went lame,
So alone in the cold I end.
