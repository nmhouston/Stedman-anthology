BECAUSE the shadows deepen’d verily,—
Because the end of all seem’d near, forsooth,—
Her gracious spirit, ever quick to ruth,
Had pity on her bond-slave, even on me.
She came in with the twilight noiselessly,
Fair as a rose, immaculate as Truth;
She lean’d above my wreck’d and wasted youth;
I felt her presence, which I could not see.
“God keep you, my poor friend,” I heard her say;
And then she kiss’d my dry, hot lips and eyes.
Kiss thou the next kiss, quiet Death, I pray;
Be instant on this hour, and so surprise
My spirit while the vision seems to stay;
Take thou the heart with the heart’s Paradise.
