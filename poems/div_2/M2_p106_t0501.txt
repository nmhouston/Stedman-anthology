BELOW lies one whose name was traced in sand.
He died, not knowing what it was to live:
Died, while the first sweet consciousness of manhood
To maiden thought electrified his soul,
Faint heatings in the calyx of the rose.
Bewilder’d reader, pass without a sigh,
In a proud sorrow! There is life with God
In other kingdom of a sweeter air.
In Eden every flower is blown: Amen.
