GOD made my lady lovely to behold,—
Above the painter’s dream he set her face,
And wrought her body in divinest grace;
He touch’d the brown hair with a sense of gold;
And in the perfect form He did enfold
What was alone as perfect, the sweet heart;
Knowledge most rare to her He did impart;
And fill’d with love and worship all her days.
And then God thought Him how it would be well
To give her music; and to Love He said,
“Bring thou some minstrel now that he may tell
How fair and sweet a thing My hands have made.”
Then at Love’s call I came, bow’d down my head,
And at His will my lyre grew audible.
