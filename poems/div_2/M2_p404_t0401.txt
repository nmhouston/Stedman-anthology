IN the golden morning of the world,
When creation’s freshness was unfurl’d,
Had earth truer, fonder hearts than now?
One, at least, in this our day, I know,
(Whisper soft, ah! benedicite!)
Faithful-fond as any heart could be
In the golden morning of the world.
And were faces, in that orient time,
Flush’d, in sooth, with more resplendent prime,
More consummate loveliness than now?
Nay, one maiden face, at least, I know
(Whisper soft, ah! benedicite!)
Just as fair as any face could be
In the golden morning of the world.
But dark shadows reign, and storms are rife,
In the once serene clear heaven of life.
Oh! sweet angel, at the shining gate,
By God’s mercy, keep one earthly fate,
One dear life—ah! benedicite!
Happy, calm, as any such could be
In the golden morning of the world!
