THERE is a soul above the soul of each,
A mightier soul, which yet to each belongs:
There is a sound made of all human speech,
And numerous as the concourse of all songs:
And in that soul lives each, in each that soul,
Though all the ages are its lifetime vast;
Each soul that dies, in its most sacred whole
Receiveth life that shall forever last.
And thus forever with a wider span
Humanity o’erarches time and death;
Man can elect the universal man,
And live in life that ends not with his breath:
And gather glory that increase still
Till Time his glass with Death’s last dust shall fill.
