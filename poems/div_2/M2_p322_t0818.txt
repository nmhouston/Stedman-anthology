OLD England’s sons are English yet,
Old England’s hearts are strong;
And still she wears her coronet
Aflame with sword and song.
As in their pride our fathers died,
If need be, so die we;
So wield we still, gainsay who will,
The sceptre of the sea.
England, stand fast; let hand and heart be steady;
Be thy first word thy last,—Ready, ay, ready!

We ’ve Releighs still for Raleigh’s part,
We ’ve Nelsons yet unknown;
The pulses of the Lion Heart
Beat on through Wellington.
Hold, Britain, hold thy creed of old,
Strong foe and steadfast friend,
And, still unto thy motto true,
Defy not, but defend.
England, stand fast; let heart and hand be steady;
Be thy first word thy last,—Ready, ay, ready!

Men whisper’d that our arm was weak,
Men said our blood was cold,
And that our hearts no longer speak
The clarion-note of old;
But let the spear and sword draw near
The sleeping lion’s den,
His island shore shall start once more
To life with armed men.
England, stand fast; let heart and hand be steady;
Be thy first word thy last,—Ready, ay, ready!
