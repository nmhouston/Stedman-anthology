CURIOUS, the ways of these folk of humble and hardly condition:
Kisses, amongst ourselves, bless me, how much they imply!
Ere you can come to a kiss, you must scale the whole gamut of courtship—
Introduction first; pretty attentions and words;
Tentative looks; and at length, perhaps the touch of a finger;
Then the confession; and then (if she allow it) the kiss.
So that a kiss comes last—’t is the crown and seal of the whole thing;
Passion avow’d by you, fondly accepted by her.
But in our Dorothy’s class, a kiss only marks the beginning:
Comes me a light-hearted swain, thinking of nothing at all;
Flings his fustian sleeve round the ample waist of the maiden;
Kisses her cheek, and she—laughingly thrusts him away.
Why, ’t is a matter of course; every good-looking damsel expects it;
’T is but the homage, she feels, paid to her beauty by men:
So that, at Kiss-in-the-Ring—an innocent game and a good one—
Strangers in plenty may kiss: nay, she pursues, in her turn.
