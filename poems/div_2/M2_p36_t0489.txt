I DREAM’D I saw a little brook
Run rippling down the Strand;
With cherry-trees and apple-trees
Abloom on either hand:
The sparrows gather’d from the Squares,
Upon the branches green;
The pigeons flock’d from Palace-Yard,
Afresh their wings to preen;
And children down St. Martin’s Lane,
And out of Westminster,
Came trooping, many a thousand strong,
With a bewilder’d air.
They hugg’d each other round the neck
And titter’d for delight,
To see the yellow daffodils,
And see the daisies white;
They roll’d upon the grassy slopes,
And drank the water clear,
While ’busses the Embankment took,
Asham’d to pass anear;
And sandwich-men stood still aghast,
And costermongers smil’d;
And the policeman on his beat
Pass’d, weeping like a child.
