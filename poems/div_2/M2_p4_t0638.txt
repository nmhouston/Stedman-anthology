KING CHARLES, and who ’ll do him right now?
King Charles, and who ’s ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse: here ’s, in hell’s despite now,
King Charles!

Who gave me the goods that went since?
Who rais’d me the house that sank once?
Who help’d me to gold I spent since?
Who found me in wine you drank once?
(Chorus)King Charles, and who ’ll do him right now?
King Charles, and who ’s ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse: here ’s, in hell’s despite now,
King Charles!

To whom us’d my boy George quaff else,
By the old fool’s side that begot him?
For whom did he cheer and laugh else,
While Noll’s damn’d troopers shot him?
(Chorus)King Charles, and who ’ll do him right now?
King Charles, and who ’s ripe for fight now?
Give a rouse: here ’s, in hell’s despite now,
King Charles!
