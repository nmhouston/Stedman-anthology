A LONELY way, and as I went my eyes
Could not unfasten from the Spring’s sweet things,
Lush sprouted grass, and all that climbs and clings
In loose, deep hedges, where the primrose lies
In her own fairness, buried blooms surprise
The plunderer bee and stop his murmurings,
And the glad flutter of a finch’s wings
Outstartle small blue speckled butterflies.
Blissfully did one speedwell plot beguile
My whole heart long; I lov’d each separate flower,
Kneeling. I look’d up suddenly—Dear God!
There stretch’d the shining plain for many a mile,
The mountains rose with what invincible power!
And how the sky was fathomless and broad!
