ONLY a touch, and nothing more:
Ah! but never so touch’d before!
Touch of lip, was it? Touch of hand?
Either is easy to understand.
Earth may be smitten with fire or frost—
Never the touch of true love lost.

Only a word, was it? Scarce a word!
Musical whisper, softly heard,
Syllabled nothing—just a breath—
’T will outlast life, and ’t will laugh at death.
Love with so little can do so much—
Only a word, sweet! Only a touch!
