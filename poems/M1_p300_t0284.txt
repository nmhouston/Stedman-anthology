TWO winged genii in the air
I greeted as they pass’d me by:
The one a bow and quiver bare,
The other shouted joyously.
Both I besought to stay their speed,
But never Love nor Youth had heed
Of my wild cry.

As swift and careless as the wind,
Youth fled, nor ever once look’d back;
A moment Love was left behind,
But follow’d soon his fellow’s track.
Yet loitering at my heart he bent
His bow, then smil’d with changed intent:
The string was slack.
