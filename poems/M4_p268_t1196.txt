THE DAY was lingering in the pale northwest,
And light was hanging o’er my head,
Night where a myriad stars were spread;
While down in the east, where the light was least,
Seemed the home of the quiet dead.
And, as I gazed on the field sublime
To watch the bright pulsating stars,
Adown the deep, where the angels sleep,
Came drawn the golden chime
Of those great spheres that sound the years
For the horologe of time;—
Millenniums numberless they told,
Millenniums a millionfold
From the ancient hour of prime!
