THE CHANGING guests, each in a different mood,
Sit at the roadside table, and arise:
And every life among them in like wise
Is a soul’s board set daily with new food.
What man has bent o’er his son’s sleep, to brood
How that face shall watch his when cold it lies?—
Or thought, as his own mother kiss’d his eyes,
Of what her kiss was when his father woo’d?
May not this ancient room thou sitt’st in dwell
In separate living souls for joy or pain?
Nay, all its corners may be painted plain
Where Heaven shows pictures of some life spent well;
And may be stamp’d, a memory all in vain,
Upon the sight of lidless eyes in Hell.
