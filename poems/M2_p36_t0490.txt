THE FLAME-WING’D seraph spake a word
To one of Galilee:—
“Be not afraid: know, of the Lord
Is that is born of thee.”

And by the poet’s bliss and woe
Learn we the will of Heaven:
He is God’s instrument; and so
Swords in his heart are seven.

He is God’s oracle and slave,
As once the priestesses;
His griefs in keeping we should have,
To heal, or make them less.
