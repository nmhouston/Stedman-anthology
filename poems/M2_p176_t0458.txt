THE BULBUL wail’d, “Oh, Rose! all night I sing,
And Thou, Beloved! utterest not one thing.”
“Dear Bird!” she answer’d, “scent and blossoming
Are music of my Song without a sound.”

The Cypress to the Tulip spake: “What bliss
Seest thou in sunshine, dancing still like this?”
“My cup,” the Tulip said, “the wind’s lips kiss;
Dancing I hear the Song without a sound.”

The gray Owl hooted to the Dove at morn,
“Why art thou happy on thy junglethorn?”
“Hearest thou not,” she cooed, “o’er Earth’s face borne
This music of the Song without a sound?”

“Ah, Darweesh!” moan’d a King, “Vainly I pray
For Allah’s comfort, kneeling day by day.”
“Sultan!” quoth he, “be meek, and hear alway
The music of His Mercy without sound.”

“Poet!” a Queen sigh’d, “why alone to thee
Come visions of that world we cannot see—
Not great nor rich?” “I borrow minstrelsy,”
Smiling he said, “from Songs without a sound.”

Shirîn-i-man! dear Lover! true and sweet,
Ask no more if I love, nor kiss my feet;
But hear, with cheek against my bosom’s beat,
The music of the Song without a sound!
