TO Spend the long warm days
Silent beside the silent-stealing streams,
To see, not gaze,—
To hear, not listen, thoughts exchanged for dreams:

See clouds that slowly pass
Trailing their shadows o’er the far faint down,
And ripening grass,
While yet the meadows wear their starry crown:

To hear the breezes sigh
Cool in the silver leaves like falling rain,
Pause and go by,
Tired wanderers o’er the solitary plain:

See far from all affright
Shy river creatures play hour after hour,
And night by night
Low in the West the white moon’s folding flower.

Thus lost to human things,
To blend at last with Nature and to hear
What songs she sings
Low to herself when there is no one near.
