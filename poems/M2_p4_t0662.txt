THOU whom these eyes saw never, say friends true,
Who say my soul, help’d onward by my song,
Though all unwittingly, has help’d thee too?
I gave but of the little that I knew:
How were the gift requited, while along
Life’s path I pace, couldst thou make weakness strong,
Help me with knowledge—for Life’s old.
Death’s new!
