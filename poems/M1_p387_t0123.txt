GIVE me thy joy in sorrow, gracious Lord,
And sorrow’s self shall like to joy appear!
Although the world should waver in its sphere
I tremble not if Thou thy peace afford;
But, Thou withdrawn, I am but as a chord
That vibrates to the pulse of hope and fear:
Nor rest I more than harps which to the air
Must answer when we place their tuneful board
Against the blast, which thrill unmeaning woe
Even in their sweetness. So no earthly wing
E’er sweeps me but to sadden. Oh, place Thou
My heart beyond the world’s sad vibrating—
And where but in Thyself? Oh, circle, me,
That I may feel no touches save of Thee.
