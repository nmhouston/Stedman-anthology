ITS masts of might, its sails so free,
Had borne the scatheless keel
Through many a day of darken’d sea,
And many a storm of steel;
When all the winds were calm, it met
(With home-returning prore)
With the lull
Of the waves
On a low lee shore.

The crest of the conqueror
On many a brow was bright;
The dew of many an exile’s eye
Had dimm’d the dancing sight;
And for love and for victory
One welcome was in store,
In the lull
Of the waves
On a low lee shore.

The voices of the night are mute
Beneath the moon’s eclipse;
The silence of the fitful flute
Is on the dying lips.
The silence of my lonely heart
Is kept forevermore
In the lull
Of the waves
On a low lee shore.
