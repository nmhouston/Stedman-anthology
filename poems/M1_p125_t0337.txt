THERE is a safe and secret place
Beneath the wings divine,
Reserv’d for all the heirs of grace:
Oh, be that refuge mine!

The least and feeblest there may bide
Uninjur’d and unaw’d;
While thousands fall on every side,
He rests secure in God.

The angels watch him on his way,
And aid with friendly arm;
And Satan, roaring for his prey,
May hate, but cannot harm.

He feeds in pastures large and fair
Of love and truth divine;
O child of God, O glory’s heir,
How rich a lot is thine!

A hand almighty to defend,
An ear for every call,
An honor’d life, a peaceful end,
And heaven to crown it all!
