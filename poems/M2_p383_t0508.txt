VENICE, thou Siren of sea-cities, wrought
By mirage, built on water, stair o’er stair,
Of sunbeams and cloud-shadows, phantom-fair,
With naught of earth to mar thy sea-born thought!
Thou floating film upon the wonder-fraught
Ocean of dreams! Thou hast no dream so rare
As are thy sons and daughters, they who wear
Foam-flakes of charm from thine enchantment caught!
O dark brown eyes! O tangles of dark hair!
O heaven-blue eyes, blonde tresses where the breeze
Plays over sun-burn’d cheeks in sea-blown air!
Firm limbs of moulded bronze! frank debonair
Smiles of deep-bosom’d women! Loves that seize
Man’s soul, and waft her on storm-melodies!
