IF only in dreams may man be fully blest,
Is heav’n a dream? Is she I clasp’d a dream?
Or stood she here even now where dew-drops gleam
And miles of furze shine golden down the West?
I seem to clasp her still—still on my breast
Her bosom beats,—I see the blue eyes beam:—
I think she kiss’d these lips, for now they seem
Scarce mine: so hallow’d of the lips they press’d!
Yon thicket’s breath—can that be eglantine?
Those birds—can they be morning’s choristers?
Can this be earth? Can these be banks of furze?
Like burning bushes fir’d of God they shine!
I seem to know them, though this body of mine
Pass’d into spirit at the touch of hers!
