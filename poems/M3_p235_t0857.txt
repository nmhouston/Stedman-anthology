Si viellesse pouvait!SCENE.—A small neat Room. In a high Voltaire Chair sits a white-haired old Gentleman.
MONSIEUR VIEUXBOIS.      BABETTE.
M. VIEUXBOIS  [turning querulously].
Day of my life! Where can she get?
Babette! I say! Babette!—Babette!

BABETTE  [entering hurriedly].Coming, M’sieu’! If M’sieu’ speaks
So loud, he won’t be well for weeks!

M. VIEUXBOIS.Where have you been?

BABETTE.        Why, M’sieu’ knows:—
April!… Ville-d’ Avray!… Ma’am’selle Rose!

M. VIEUXBOIS.Ah! I am old,—and I forget.
Was the place growing green, Babette?

BABETTE.But of a greenness!—yes, M’sieu’!
And then the sky so blue!—so blue!—
And when I dropped my immortelle,
How the birds sang!  [Lifting her apron to her eyes.
This poor Ma’am’selle!

M. VIEUXBOIS.You ’re a good girl, Babette, but she,—
She was an Angel, verily.
Sometimes I think I see her yet
Stand smiling by the cabinet;
And once, I know, she peeped and laughed
Betwixt the curtains…
Where ’s the draught?  [She gives him a cup.
Now I shall sleep, I think, Babette;—
Sing me your Norman chansonnette.

BABETTE [sings].    Once at the Angelus
(Ere I was dead),
Angels all glorious
Came to my Bed;—
Angels in blue and white
Crowned on the Head.

M. VIEUXBOIS  [drowsily].She was an Angel … Once she laughed…
What, was I dreaming?
Where ’s the draught?

BABETTE  [showing the empty cup].The draught, M’sieu’?

M. VIEUXBOIS.        How I forget!
I am so old! But sing, Babette!

BABETTE  [sings].    One was the Friend I left
Stark in the Snow;
One was the Wife that died
Long,—long ago;
One was the Love I lost …
How could she know?

M. VIEUXBOIS  [murmuring].Ah, Paul!… old Paul!… Eulalie too!
And Rose … And O!… the sky so blue!

BABETTE  [sings].    One had my Mother’s eyes,
Wistful and mild;
One had my Father’s face;
One was a Child:
All of them bent to me,—
Bent down and smiled!

He is asleep!

M. VIEUXBOIS  [almost inaudibly].        How I forget!
I am so old … Good night, Babette!
