O WIND of the Mountain, Wind of the Mountain, hear!
I have a prayer to whisper in thine ear:—
Hush, pine-tree, hush! Be silent, sycamore!
Cease thy wild waving, ash-tree, old and hoar!
Flow softly, stream! My voice is faint with fear—
O Wind of the Mountain, Wind of the Mountain, hear!

In the dull city, by the lowland shore,
Pale grows the cheek, so rosy-fresh of yore.
Woe for the child—the fair blithe-hearted child—
Once thy glad playmate on the breezy wild!
Hush, pine-tree, hush!—my voice is faint with fear—
O Wind of the Mountain, Wind of the Mountain, hear!

Pale grows the cheek, and dim the sunny eyes,
And the voice falters, and the laughter dies.
Woe for the child! She pines, on that sad shore,
For the free hills and happy skies of yore.
Hush, river, hush!—my voice is faint with fear—
O Wind of the Mountain, Wind of the Mountain, hear!

O Wind of the Mountain, thou art swift and strong—
Follow, for love’s sake, though the way be long.
Follow, oh! follow, over down and dale,
To the far city in the lowland vale.
Hush, pine-tree, hush!—my voice is faint with fear—
O Wind of the Mountain, Wind of the Mountain, hear!

Kiss the dear lips, and bid the laughters rise;
Flush the wan cheek, and brighten the dim eyes;
Sing songs of home, and soon, from grief and pain,
Win back thy playmate, blessed Wind, again!
Win back my darling—while away my fear—
O Wind of the Mountain, Wind of the Mountain, hear!
