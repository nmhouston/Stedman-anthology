I WADNA gi’e my ain wife
For ony wife I see;
I wadna gi’e my ain wife
For ony wife I see;
A bonnier yet I ’ve never seen,
A better canna be—
I wadna gi’e my ain wife
For ony wife I see!

O couthie is my ingle-cheek,
An’ cheerie is my Jean;
I never see her angry look,
Nor hear her word on ane.
She ’s gude wi’ a’ the neebours roun’,
An’ aye gude wi’ me—
I wadna gi’e my ain wife
For ony wife I see.

An’ O her looks sae kindlie,
They melt my heart outright,
When o’er the baby at her breast
She hangs wi’ fond delight;
She looks intill its bonnie face,
An’ syne looks to me—
I wadna gi’e my ain wife
For ony wife I see.
