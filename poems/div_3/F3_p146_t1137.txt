IF all the world were right,
How fair our love would grow,
At what a golden height
Its spotless flower could blow.

Through what untroubled air
Its fragrant boughs would spread,
On fruit how sweet and rare
Should we be freely fed.

But ah, what could we tend,
With sorrow and delight,
Our hearts how should we spend,
If all the world were right?
