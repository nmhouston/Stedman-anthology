“OUR little babe,” each said, “shall be
Like unto thee”—“Like unto thee!”
“Her mother’s”—“Nay, his father’s”—“eyes,”
“Dear curls like thine”—but each replies,
“As thine, all thine, and naught of me.”

What sweet solemnity to see
The little life upon thy knee,
And whisper as so soft it lies,—
“Our little babe!”

For, whether it be he or she,
A David or a Dorothy,
“As mother fair,” or “father wise,”
Both when it ’s “good,” and when it cries,
One thing is certain,—it will be
Our little babe.
