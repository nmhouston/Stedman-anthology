GREEN leaves panting for joy with the great wind rushing through;
A burst of the sun from cloud and a sparkle on valley and hill,
Gold on the corn, and red on the poppy, and on the rill
Silver, and over all white clouds afloat in the blue.

Swallows that dart, a lark unseen, innumerous song
Chirruped and twittered, a lowing of cows in the meadow grass,
Murmuring gnats, and bees that suck their honey and pass:
God is alive, and at work in the world:—we did it wrong.

Human eyes, and human hands, and a human face
Darkly beheld before in a vision, not understood,
Do I at last begin to feel as I stand and gaze
Why God waited for this, then called the world very good?
