THE ROSY musk-mallow blooms where the south wind blows,
O my gypsy rose!
In the deep dark lanes where thou and I must meet;
So sweet!
Before the harvest moon’s gold glints over the down,
Or the brown-sailed trawler returns to the gray sea-town,
The rosy musk-mallow sways, and the south wind’s laughter
Follows our footsteps after!

The rosy musk-mallow blooms by the moor-brook’s flow,
So daintily O!
Where thou and I in the silence of night must pass,
My lass!
Over the stream with its ripple of song, to-night,
We will fly, we will run together, my heart’s delight!
The rosy musk-mallow sways, and the moor-brook’s laughter
Follows our footsteps after!

The rosy musk-mallow blooms within sound of the sea;
It curtseys to thee,
O my gypsy-queen, it curtseys adown to thy feet;
So sweet!
When dead leaves drift through the dusk of the autumn day,
And the red elf-lanthorns hang from the spindle-spray,
The rosy musk-mallow sways, and the sea ’s wild laughter
Follows our footsteps after!

The rosy musk-mallow blooms where the dim wood sleeps,
And the bind-weed creeps;
Through tangled wood-paths unknown we must take our flight,
To-night!
As the pale hedge-lilies around the dark elder wind,
Clasp thy white arms about me, nor look behind.
The rosy musk-mallow is closed, and the soft leaves’ laughter
Follows our footsteps after!
