SO I arm thee for the final night,
And for thy one defeat;
For God upon his side shall fight
When thou and he shall meet.
I know, for good or evil, thine
Will be a well-fought field—
For good or evil, master mine,
If I may bear thy shield!

Now art thou the unfaithfullest
Of all that bore the vow—
Yet some there are that love thee best,
Most honor, even now.
I see the face I held divine
Ah, yet divine revealed!
For good or evil, master mine,
If I may bear thy shield!
