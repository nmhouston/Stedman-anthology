ALAS! who knows or cares, my love,
If our love live or die,—
If thou thy frailty, sweet, should prove,
Or my soul thine deny?
Yet merging sorrow in delight,
Love’s dream disputes our devious night.

None know, sweet love, nor care a thought
For our heart’s vague desire,
Nor if our longing come to naught,
Or burn in aimless fire;
Let them alone, we ’ll waste no sighs:
Cling closer, love, and close thine eyes!
