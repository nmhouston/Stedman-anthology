I FOUND him openly wearing her token;
I knew that her troth could never be broken;
I laid my hand on the hilt of my sword,—
He did the same, and he spoke no word;
I faced him with his villainy;
He laughed, and said, “She gave it me.”
We searched for seconds, they soon were found;
They measured our swords; they measured the ground;
They held to the deadly work too fast;
They thought to gain our place at last.
We fought in the sheen of a wintry wood;
The fair white snow was red with his blood;
But his was the victory, for, as he died,
He swore by the rood that he had not lied.
