COME and kiss me, mistress Beauty,
I will give you all that ’s due t’ye.

I will taste your rosebud lips
Daintily as the bee sips;
At your bonny eyes I ’ll look
Like a scholar at his book:

On my bosom you shall rest,
Like a robin on her nest:
Round my body you shall twine,
I ’ll be elm, and you be vine:

In a bumper of your breath
I would drain a draught of death;
In the tangles of your hair
I ’d be hanged and never care.

Then come kiss me, mistress Beauty,
I will give you all that ’s due t’ ye.
