DEAR, let me dream of love,
Ah! though a dream it be!
I ’ll ask no boon, above
A word, a smile, from thee:
At most, in some still hour, one kindly thought of me.

Sweet, let me gaze awhile
Into those radiant eyes!
I ’ll scheme not to beguile
The heart, that deeper lies
Beneath them, than you star in night’s pellucid skies.

Love, let my spirit bow
In worship at thy shrine!
I ’ll swear thou shalt not know
One word from lips of mine,
An instant’s pain to send through that shy soul of thine.
