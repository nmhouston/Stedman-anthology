IN thy white bosom Love is laid;
His rosy cheek within that nest
Another dawning there hath made,
Causing in me a new unrest.
Like as the sun the hills with fire
He wakes anew my old desire.

But ah, thou dost defy the boy,
Too strong for him and me dost prove,
The freezing snows proclaim thee coy,
Purloin the blushing hope of Love
Who flies, alas for thy disdain!
The throne where he alone should reign.
