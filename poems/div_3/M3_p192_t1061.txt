SIGH his name into the night
With the stars for company,
From thy lips ’t will take fair flight,
Doing thee no injury,
If by the sea or trysting-tree
Thou breathe it in no company.

Whisper it from thy full heart,
Let none hear thy passion moan,
Safe from cruel pang or smart,
To the cold world unbeknown,
By darkling tree or silent sea
With Love alone for company.

In thy heart of hearts let sleep
All thy rapture; and his name
True in purity shall keep
All its vital force and flame;
Fickle speech and falsest jar
Come from lips that loudest are.
