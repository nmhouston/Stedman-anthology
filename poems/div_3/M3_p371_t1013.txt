THROUGH the seeding grass,
And the tall corn,
The wind goes:
With nimble feet,
And blithe voice,
Calling, calling,
The wind goes
Through the seeding grass,
And the tall corn.

What calleth the wind,
Passing by—
The shepherd-wind?
Far and near
He laugheth low,
And the red poppies
Lift their heads
And toss i’ the sun.
A thousand thousand blooms
Tossed i’ the air,
Banners of joy,
For ’t is the shepherd-wind
Passing by,
Singing and laughing low
Through the seeding grass
And the tall corn.
