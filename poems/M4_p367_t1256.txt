THE BAY is set with ashy sails,
With purple shades that fade and flee,
And curling by in silver wales
The tide is straining from the sea.

The grassy points are slowly drowned,
The water laps and overrolls
The wicker pêche; with shallow sound
A light wave labors on the shoals.

The crows are feeding in the foam,
They rise in crowds tumultuously,
“Come home,” they cry, “come home,—come home,
And leave the marshes to the sea.”
