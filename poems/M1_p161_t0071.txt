HIS life was private; safely led, aloof
From the loud world,—which yet he understood
Largely and wisely, as no worldling could.
For he, by privilege of his nature proof
Against false glitter, from beneath the roof
Of privacy, as from a cave, survey’d
With steadfast eye its flickering light and shade,
And gently judged for evil and for good.
But whilst he mix’d not for his own behoof
In public strife, his spirit glow’d with zeal,
Not shorn of action, for the public weal,—
For truth and justice as its warp and woof,
For freedom as its signature and seal.
His life, thus sacred from the world, discharged
From vain ambition and inordinate care,
In virtue exercis’d, by reverence rare
Lifted, and by humility enlarged,
Became a temple and a place of prayer.
In latter years he walk’d not singly there;
For one was with him, ready at all hours
His griefs, his joys, his inmost thoughts to share,
Who buoyantly his burthens help’d to bear,
