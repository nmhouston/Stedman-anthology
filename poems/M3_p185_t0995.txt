THOUGH our great love a little wrong his fame,
And seeing him with such familiar eyes
We say “how kind” more often than “how wise,”
Such is the simple reverence he would claim;
He would not have us call him by a name
Higher than that of friend,—yet by this grave
We feel the saint not pure, nor hero brave,
And all the martyr’s patience put to shame.
Brother, we leave thee by thy sister’s side;
Whom such a love bound let not death divide;
She is at peace, now, brother, thou canst rest;
Thy long sad guardianship of love is o’er,
And gentle Shakespeare on the dead men’s shore
Salutes thy gentle ghost that praised him best.
