AWAKE, my heart, to be lov’d, awake, awake!
The darkness silvers away, the morn doth break,
It leaps in the sky: unrisen lustres slake
The o’ertaken moon. Awake, O heart, awake!

She, too, that loveth awaketh and hopes for thee;
Her eyes already have sped the shades that flee,
Already they watch the path thy feet shall take:
Awake, O heart to be lov’d, awake, awake!

And if thou tarry from her,—if this could be,—
She cometh herself, O heart, to be lov’d, to thee;
For thee would unasham’d herself forsake:
Awake to be lov’d, my heart, awake, awake!

Awake! The land is scatter’d with light, and see,
Uncanopied sleep is flying from field and tree;
And blossoming boughs of April in laughter shake:
Awake, O heart, to be lov’d, awake, awake!

Lo, all things wake and tarry and look for thee:
She looketh and saith, “O sun, now bring him to me.
Come, more ador’d, O ador’d, for his coming’s sake,
And awake, my heart, to be lov’d, awake, awake!”
