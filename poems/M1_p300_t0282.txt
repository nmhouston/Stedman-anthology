OUR 1 England’s heart is sound as oak;
Our English will is firm;
And through our actions Freedom spoke
In history’s proudest term:
When Blake was lord from shore to shore,
And Cromwell rul’d the land,
And Milton’s words were shields of power
To stay the oppressor’s hand.

Our England’s heart is yet as sound,
As firm our English will;
And tyrants, be they cowl’d or crown’d,
Shall find us fearless still.
And though our Vane be in his tomb,
Though Hampden’s blood is cold,
Their spirits live to lead our doom
As in the days of old.

Our England’s heart is stout as oak;
Our English will as brave
As when indignant Freedom spoke
From Eliot’s prison grave.
And closing yet again with Wrong,
A world in arms shall see
Our England foremost of the strong
And first among the free.
