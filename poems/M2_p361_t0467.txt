I STILL keep open Memory’s chamber: still
Drink from the fount of Youth’s perennial stream.
It may be in old age an idle dream
Of those dear children; but beyond my will
They come again, and dead affections thrill
My pulseless heart, for now once more they seem
To be alive, and wayward fancies teem
In my fond brain, and all my senses fill.
Come, Alice, leave your books; ’t is I who call;
Bind up your hair, and teasing—did you say
Kissing—that kitten? Evey, come with me;
Mary, grave darling, take my hand: yes, all!
I have three hands to-day! A Holiday.
A Holiday, Papa? Woe ’s me! ’t is Memory!
