PASSING feet pause, as they pass,
By this little slab of slate.
People, if they go this way,
By the linchen’d wicket gate,
At each other look and say,
“Pity, pity! sad it was!”
Here have fallen as many tears
As the months in her short years.

Seven and ten brief sunny springs;
Scarce so many winter snows:
Here the little speedwell keeps
Watch beside the pale dog-rose;
On this hillock, while she sleeps
Underneath, the red-breast sings.
Wedded on an April day!
In the Autumn laid away!
