REIGN on, majestic Ville Marie!
Spread wide thine ample robes of state;
The heralds cry that thou art great,
And proud are thy young sons of thee.
Mistress of half a continent,
Thou risest from thy girlhood’s rest;
We see thee conscious heave thy breast
And feel thy rank and thy descent.

Sprung of the saint and chevalier!
And with the Scarlet Tunic wed!
Mount Royal’s crown upon thy head,
And, past thy footstool, broad and clear
St. Lawrence sweeping to the sea;
Reign on, majestic Ville Marie!
