POOR wither’d rose and dry,
Skeleton of a rose,
Risen to testify
To love’s sad close:

Treasur’d for love’s sweet sake,
That of joy past
Thou mightst again awake
Memory at last.

Yet is thy perfume sweet;
Thy petals red
Yet tell of summer heat,
And the gay bed:

Yet, yet recall the glow
Of the gazing sun,
When at thy bush we two
Join’d hands in one.

But, rose, thou hast not seen,
Thou hast not wept,
The change that pass’d between
Whilst thou hast slept.

To me thou seemest yet
The dead dream’s thrall;
While I live and forget
Dream, truth, and all.

Thou art more fresh than I,
Rose, sweet and red:
Salt on my pale cheeks lie
The tears I shed.
