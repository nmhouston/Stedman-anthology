YON silvery billows breaking on the beach
Fall back in foam beneath the star-shine clear,
The while my rhymes are murmuring in your ear
A restless lore like that the billows teach;
For on these sonnet-waves my soul would reach
From its own depths, and rest within you, dear,
As, through the billowy voices yearning here,
Great nature strives to find a human speech.
A sonnet is a wave of melody:
From heaving waters of the impassion’d soul
A billow of tidal music one and whole
Flows in the “octave;” then returning free,
Its ebbing surges in the “sestet” roll
Back to the deeps of Life’s tumultuous sea.
