IF you be that May Margaret
That lived on Kendal Green,
Then where ’s that sunny hair of yours
That crowned you like a queen?
That sunny hair is dim, lad,
They said was like a crown—
The red gold turned to gray, lad,
The night a ship went down.

If you be yet May Margaret,
May Margaret now as then,
Then where ’s that bonny smile of yours
That broke the hearts of men?
The bonny smile is wan, lad,
That once was glad as day—
And oh! ’t is weary smiling
To keep the tears away.

If you be yet May Margaret,
As yet you swear to me,
Then where ’s that proud, cold heart of yours
That sent your love to sea?
Ah! me, that heart is broken,
The proud cold heart has bled
For one light word outspoken,
For all the love unsaid.

Then Margaret, my Margaret,
If all you say be true,
Your hair is yet the sunniest gold,
Your eyes the sweetest blue.
And dearer yet and fairer yet
For all the coming years—
The fairer for the waiting,
The dearer for the tears!
