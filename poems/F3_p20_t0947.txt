I STOOD to hear that bold
Sentence of grit and mould,
Earth to earth; they thrust
On his coffin dust;
Stones struck against his grave:
Oh, the old days, the brave!

Just with a pebble’s fall,
Grave-digger, you turn all
Bliss to bereaving;
To catch the cleaving
Of Atropa’s fine shears
Would less hurt human ears.

Live senses that death dooms!
For friendship in dear rooms,
Slow-lighting faces,
Hand-clasps, embraces,
Ashes on ashes grind:
Oh, poor lips left behind!
