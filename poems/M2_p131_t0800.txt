DAWNThe RoseWHEN, think you, comes the Wind,
The Wind that kisses me and is so kind?
Lo, how the Lily sleeps! her sleep is light;
Would I were like the Lily, pale and white!
Will the Wind come?

The Beech        Perchance for you too soon.

The RoseIf not, how could I live until the noon?
What, think you, Beech-tree, makes the Wind delay?
Why comes he not at breaking of the day?

The BeechHush, child, and, like the Lily, go to sleep.

The RoseYou know I cannot.

The Beech        Nay, then, do not weep.

(After a pause)Your lover comes, be happy now, O Rose!
He softly through my bending branches goes.
Soon he shall come, and you shall feel his kiss.

The RoseAlready my flush’d heart grows faint with bliss;
Love, I have long’d for you through all the night.

The WindAnd I to kiss your petals warm and bright.

The RoseLaugh round me, Love, and kiss me; it is well.
Nay, have no fear, the Lily will not tell.

MORNINGThe Rose’T was dawn when first you came; and now the sun
Shines brightly and the dews of dawn are done.
’T is well you take me so in your embrace;
But lay me back again into my place,
For I am worn, perhaps with bliss extreme.

The WindNay, you must wake, Love, from this childish dream.

The Rose’T is you, Love, who seem changed; your laugh is loud,
And ’neath your stormy kiss my head is bow’d
O Love, O Wind, a space will you not spare?

The WindNot while your petals are so soft and fair.

The RoseMy buds are blind with leaves, they cannot see,—
O Love, O Wind, will you not pity me?

EVENINGThe BeechO Wind, a word with you before you pass;
What did you to the Rose that on the grass
Broken she lies and pale, who lov’d you so?

The WindRoses must live and love, and winds must blow.
