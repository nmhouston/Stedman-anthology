QUICK gleam, that ridest on the gossamer!
How oft I see thee, with thy wavering lance,
Tilt at the midges in their evening dance,
A gentle joust set on by summer air!
How oft I watch thee from my gardenchair!
And, failing that, I search the lawns and bowers,
To find thee floating o’er the fruits and flowers,
And doing thy sweet work in silence there.
Thou art the poet’s darling, ever sought
In the fair garden or the breezy mead;
The wind dismounts thee not; thy buoyant thread
Is as the sonnet, poising one bright thought,
That moves but does not vanish: borne along
Like light,—a golden drift through all the song!
