WILD, wild wind, wilt thou never cease they sighing?
Dark, dark night, wilt thou never wear away?
Cold, cold church, in thy death sleep lying,
Thy Lent is past, thy Passion here, but not thine Easterday.

Peace, faint heart, though the night be dark and sighing;
Rest, fair corpse, where thy Lord himself hath lain.
Weep, dear Lord, where thy bride is lying;
Thy tears shall wake her frozen limbs to life and health again.
