WE shall lodge at the sign of the Grave, you say;
Well, the road is a long one we trudge, my friend,
So why should we grieve at the break of the day?
Let us sing, let us drink, let us love, let us play,—
We can keep our sighs for the journey’s end.

We shall lodge at the sign o’ the Grave, you say;
Well, since we are nearing our journey’s end,
Our hearts should be happy while yet they may:
Let us sing, let us drink, let us love, let us play,
For perhaps it ’s a comfortless inn, my friend.
