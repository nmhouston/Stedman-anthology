“A SEAT for three, where host and guest
May side-by-side pass toast or jest;
And be their number two or three,
With elbow-room and liberty,
What need to wander east or west?

“A book for thought, a nook for rest,
And meet for fasting or for fest,
In fair and equal parts to be
A seat for three.

“Then give you pleasant company,
For youth or elder shady tree;
A roof for council or sequest,
A corner in a homely nest;
Free, equal, and fraternally,
A seat for three.”
