TAKE me, Mother Earth, to thy cold breast,
And fold me there in everlasting rest!
The long day is o’er,
I ’m weary, I would sleep;
But deep, deep,
Never to waken more.

I have had joy and sorrow, I have prov’d
What life could give, have lov’d, and been belov’d;
I am sick, and heart-sore,
And weary; let me sleep;
But deep, deep,
Never to waken more.

To thy dark chamber, Mother Earth, I come,
Prepare thy dreamless bed in my last home;
Shut down the marble door,
And leave me! Let me sleep;
But deep, deep,
Never to waken more!
