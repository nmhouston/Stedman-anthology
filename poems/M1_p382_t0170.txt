THE ROSE thou gav’st at parting—
Hast thou forgot the hour?
The moon was on the river,
The dew upon the flower:
Thy voice was full of tenderness,
But, ah! thy voice misleads;
The rose is like thy promises,
Its thorn is like thy deeds.

The winter cometh bleakly,
And dark the time must be;
But I can deem it summer
To what thou ’st prov’d to me.
The snow that meets the sunlight
Soon hastens from the scene;
But melting snow is lasting,
To what thy faith hath been.
