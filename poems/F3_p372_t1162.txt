O MOTHER, mother, I swept the hearth, I set his chair and the white board spread,
I prayed for his coming to our kind Lady when Death’s sad doors would let out the dead;
A strange wind rattled the window-pane, and down the lane a dog howled on.
I called his name and the candle flame burnt dim, pressed a hand the doorlatch upon.
Deelish! Deelish! my woe forever that I could not sever coward flesh from fear.
I called his name and the pale Ghost came; but I was afraid to meet my dear.
O mother, mother, in tears I checked the sad hours past of the year that ’s o’er,
Till by God’s grace I might see his face and hear the sound of his voice once more;
The chair I set from the cold and wet, he took when he came from unknown skies
Of the land of the dead; on my bent brown head I felt the reproach of his saddened eyes;
I closed my lids on my heart’s desire, crouched by the fire, my voice was dumb;
At my clean-swept hearth he had no mirth, and at my table he broke no crumb.
Deelish! Deelish! my woe forever that I could not sever coward flesh from fear:
His chair put aside when the young cock cried, and I was afraid to meet my dear.
