’T IS evening now!
O Saviour, wilt not thou
Enter my home and heart,
Nor ever hence depart,
Even when the morning breaks,
And earth again awakes?
Thou wilt abide with me,
And I with thee.

The world is old!
Its air grows dull and cold;
Upon its aged face
The wrinkles come apace;
Its western sky is wan,
Its youth and joy are gone.
O Master, be our light,
When o’er us falls the night.

Evil is round!
Iniquities abound;
Our cottage will be lone
When the great Sun is gone;
O Saviour, come and bless,
Come share our loneliness;
We need a comforter;
Take up thy dwelling here.
