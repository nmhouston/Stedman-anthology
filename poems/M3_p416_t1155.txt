COME while the afternoon of May
Is sweet with many a lilac-spray,
Come while the sparrows chirping fare
From branch to branch across the square.

Come like the dawn and bring to me
The fresh winds of an open sea,
Come like the stars of night and bear
All consolation in thine hair.

Bring me release from ancient pain,
Bring me the hopes of joy found vain,
Bring me thy sweetness of the dove,
Come, sweet, and bring thyself and love!
